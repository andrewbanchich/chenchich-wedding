<h2>About Ju Yi</h2>

Ju Yi /<a href="/images/ju-yi-name.jpg">rú è</a>/ was born and raised in Taiwan. She came to Buffalo in 2011 to pursue her MBA. She currently works at Roswell Park Cancer Institute as a Business Operations Analyst. In her spare time, Ju Yi enjoys watching Microsoft Excel tutorial videos on YouTube, listening to Podcasts, jogging, and of course wedding planning.

<h2>About Andrew</h2>

Andrew was born and raised in Buffalo, New York, one of the most excellent places to live in the United States. In his spare time, Andrew enjoys studying Icelandic, reading Viking Eddas by a warm fire, looking at his knife collection, and watching Netflix.

<h2>How They Met</h2>

The couple met at Andrew’s prior work place, Kevin Guest House, on March 4th, 2014. Ju Yi’s coworker, friend, and now Maid of Honor, Liz Penepent, invited Ju Yi to be a volunteer dinner host at Kevin Guest House. Andrew found this bald girl really cool (Ju Yi had just gone Bald for Bucks to raise money for cancer research the previous day) and asked Liz for Ju Yi’s phone number. Not being able to resist Andrew’s disarming wit and charm, Ju Yi obliged and they have been happily together ever since.

<h2>The Proposal</h2>

Within a year of knowing each other, Ju Yi and Andrew already knew they would be getting married. After a year it was impossible for them to even remember who brought it up first or when they began to talk about it.

On August 9th, 2015, Andrew presented the ring to Ju Yi on the porch of his family’s house on Cape Cod, where he had often visited his grandparents—a house that is filled with nearly 200 years of his family’s memories, and now has one more.
