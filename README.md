# The Chenchich Wedding Website
My wedding website. Originally a WordPress site, I used the [Fukasawa theme](http://www.andersnoren.se/teman/fukasawa-wordpress-theme/) by [Anders Nor√©n](http://www.andersnoren.se/), making a lot of modifications along the way.

After my wedding, I decided to convert it to Jekyll.
