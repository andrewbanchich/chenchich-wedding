<span class="wedding-party-title">Father of the Bride<br/>King Yau Chan</span>

<p>King Yau took up farming after retiring from his career in the textile industry. When King Yau first learned Ju Yi and Andrew were engaged, he planned to raise a goat, harvest the fiber, and make a cashmere sweater to endure the cold Buffalo weather. Thankfully, the wedding is in the summer. Now he is excited that this will be his first time visiting the United States.</p>

<span class="wedding-party-title">Father of the Groom<br/>Thomas Banchich</span>

<p>Tom, a Classics professor, enjoys Plato, football, playing with toy dinosaurs, and Kenny Rogers’ “Jackass.” A man of many surprising talents, he has discovered a passion for wedding planning and has helped Ju Yi and Andrew answer many important questions along the way. He also harbors a passion for doing dishes; his future daughter-in-law has to fight him to stop whenever he visits their apartment.</p>

<span class="wedding-party-title">Mother of the Bride<br/>Li Chin Huang</span>

<p>Li Chin sees Ju Yi as her most well-deserved bragging right. Her only daughter is getting married halfway around the world, so she is (of course) feeling kind of lost. However, knowing Andrew will take great care of Ju Yi, Li Chin is happy to hand her best daughter over to him.</p>

<span class="wedding-party-title">Bridesmaid<br/>Hui Wen Chen</span>

<p>Hui Wen (Sonya) and Ju Yi both taught English at HESS International Educational Group when they were in college, and the two became good friends. If you hear Hui Wen call Ju Yi “Emma,” do not be confused; “Teacher Emma” was Ju Yi’s “stage name” as a teacher. Hui Wen is sweet, enthusiastic, and speaks both English and Mandarin Chinese very well. Ju Yi knows Hui Wen would be a wonderful ambassador at the wedding.</p>

<p>Robert is Andrew’s cousin. He is a world traveler and went to Iceland with Andrew and his sister, Emily. Robert is an engineer at a nuclear power plant. If he is glowing it is (probably) because he just married Abbey Tobe last April.</p>
